# Wordle-JavaFX
This project is building the game "Wordle" aka JORDLE using JavaFX. There is also an extra feature "Dordle" to this game. TEST YOUR JAVA WORD KNOWLEDGE;)

There are also other classes that I created that implement the game using different methods.
  * WordlePractice = uses a console implementation for the game.
  * WordlePractice2 = is just a simple implementation of Wordle Game (after winning, there is no stopping condition)
  * WordlePractice3 = uses a text field instead of the PressOnKey implementation of the game
  * TestDordle = is used to impelement dordle. After clicking to go to Dordle, you use the text field to try with your guess. (after winning, there is no stopping condition)


INSTRUCTION
  * There is a "Word" class that has a list of Java related 5 letter-words
  * You will have a total of 5 guesses
  * The objective of the game is to try and guess the target word.
        * If the character is at the correct spot, it will turn green
        * If the character is within the target word, it will turn yellow
        * If the character is not in the target word, it will turn red

HAVE FUN!!!
